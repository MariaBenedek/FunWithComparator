# FunWithComparator

This project is an experimentation with the <i>java.util.Comparator&lt;T></i> interface.
<br><br>
It reads data from a file and treats them as objects. However, these objects are only used to implement the Comparator with complex data.
<br>
The essence of the project is contained in the <i>main.services.CompareBuilder</i> class.
